# Simple Chess
A basic version of a game of chess.

This isn't the most exciting way to play chess.

Just pull the code and run make in the folder with the make file and then type ./chess.
The program will execute each move in ChessMain.cpp and announce where the pieces have moved and if any pieces have been taken or if the king is in check, stale mate, or check mate.
This program does not account for castling, promotion, or en passant.

ChessMain.cpp has some extensive tests to make sure that various illegal moves can't be performed but feel free to modify your own version to play out a game you have recorded or modify ChessMain.cpp to take user input like the Facebook Messenger Chess app.

For more information, check out the [specification](https://github.com/shadykdc/Simple_Chess/blob/master/spec-550-3-0.pdf).
