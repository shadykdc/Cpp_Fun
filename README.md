# Simple Chess
A basic version of a game of chess.

This isn't the most exciting way to play chess but in ChessMain.cpp you'll find all the moves have been hardcoded in. This could be modified to have user input as well but for now I'll leave it how it is. Just pull the code and run make in the folder with the make file and then type ./chess. The program will execute each move and announce if any pieces have been taken or if the king is in check, stale mate, or check mate. This program does not account for castling, promotion, or en passant.
